# Requirements

- Python 3
- pip

# Usage

Download the requirements by running:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the script via:

```sh
python3 main.py ${PATH_TO_MODLIST_FILE}
# e.g.
python3 main.py ~/Downloads/mycoolmodlist.html

If you're on Windows, you may need to use `python` instead of `python3`
